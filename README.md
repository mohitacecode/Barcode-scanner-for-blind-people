# Barcode-scanner-for-blind-people

This project is developed to make the life of blind people easy. This is a camera based system to scan the barcode from the image and read the description of the product with
the help of Id stored in the barcode.The audio tone is modulated to help the user center the barcode in the image and bring the camera close enough to the barcode to capture
detailed images of it and extract the product information using barcode id. This is very beneficial in case of finding out the description of packaged goods to the blind people and
thus helping them in deciding to purchase product or not especially which are packaged.This is because it becomes very difficult for the blind people to distinguish between the
packaged goods. Thus this application really benefits blind and visually impaired people and thus making their work of identifying products easy. This is very easy to use and
affordable as it requires only camera for reading barcode.This project can be implemented to scan the barcode to identify the Id stored in it and read out the information of product
using barode id in any shopping mall, supermarket, Book stores, Medical stores etc.
